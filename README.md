# 7-Day Hackathon: Building a Marketplace

This is a summary of our 7-day Hackathon where we worked to create a marketplace from start to finish. Here's what we did each day:

## Day 1: Planning the Foundation
We started by using paper and pencil to:
- Set business goals.
- Create a basic plan for our data.
- Outline what we wanted to achieve with our marketplace.

## Day 2: Setting Up the Technical Plan
Next, we moved to planning the technical side:
- Picked the tools and technology we would use.
- Designed how the system would work.
- Prepared our computers and tools for development.

## Day 3: Connecting APIs and Moving Data
We connected to important external services (APIs) and moved our data:
- Linked up with external APIs.
- Transferred data from old systems to the new one.
- Made sure everything worked together smoothly.

## Day 4: Building the Marketplace
We built the key parts of our marketplace:
- Created the main pages and features.
- Added extra features to make it better for users.
- Linked the frontend (what users see) with the backend (the server).

## Day 5: Testing and Improving
We tested everything to find and fix problems:
- Ran tests to check for any issues.
- Improved the backend system.
- Made the marketplace faster and more reliable.

## Day 6: Getting Ready to Launch
We prepared to launch the marketplace:
- Set up a staging area for final tests.
- Made sure everything was ready for the live launch.
- Checked that the deployment process would go smoothly.

## Day 7: Launching and Monitoring
Finally, we launched the marketplace:
- Made it live for everyone to use.
- Watched for any problems and fixed them quickly.
- Set up tools to monitor how things were running and get user feedback.

## Conclusion
In just seven days, we went from an idea to a live marketplace. Each day had a clear focus that helped us stay on track and successfully launch a working product. Now, we’re ready to keep improving based on what our users need.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
